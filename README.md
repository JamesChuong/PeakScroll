🏔️ PeakScroll

Because your feed should match your mood.

🚀 Overview

This project pioneers the next generation of personalized content consumption by combining computer vision, emotion detection, and browser automation.

The system runs a lightweight vision model locally using OpenCV to read facial expressions in real time. If the system detects that a user is bored, unhappy, or frustrated while watching short-form content on YouTube Shorts or Instagram Reels, it automatically sends a command via the Chrome DevTools Protocol to scroll to the next video.

Instead of mindlessly swiping, your content feed adapts to your emotions—making scrolling smarter, healthier, and more human.

🌟 Key Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection – Polls user’s webcam feed to classify emotional state.
Adaptive Scrolling – If negative emotion is detected, instantly scrolls to the next reel.
Local & Private – All computer vision runs locally; no cloud uploads or data leaks.
Seamless Integration – Works directly with Chrome through the DevTools Protocol.
Customizable Interface – Lightweight HTML/CSS config panel for fine-tuning preferences.
🧠 Tech Stack
Python – Core logic and OpenCV-based emotion recognition.
OpenCV – Facial landmark detection and emotion classification pipeline.
Chrome DevTools Protocol – Automates browser scrolling behavior.
HTML/CSS – Configuration and user interface.
🔮 Why This Matters

Short-form video platforms dominate user attention—but they don’t adapt to how we actually feel. This project is a step toward empathetic computing, where the interface responds to our emotions instead of ignoring them.

For investors and innovators, this represents:

A cutting-edge AI demonstration of emotion-aware interfaces.
A potential consumer product for healthier engagement with addictive media.
A blueprint for emotion-driven UX, extendable to gaming, e-learning, and productivity.

In short: this will change the scrolling game forever.
